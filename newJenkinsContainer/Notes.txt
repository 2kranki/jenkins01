I created a new version of the Jenkins Docker container so that I could compile Go and Clang programs inside it. To build the container, just issue, "docker-compose build" from the 'build' directory.

To use docker for building images only in this container, you must have adjust the docker-compose.yaml file in this directory.

Also, I pushed this image to Docker Hub with:
	docker login		# You will need to reply with 'kranki' and Docker Hub password.
	docker push kranki/jenkins:latest
